      <h3>Chief Editor</h3>
      <p><p>Jill is an avid fruit grower based in the south of France. She has a passion for all things fruit-related and loves to share her knowledge with others. Jill is also a talented writer and enjoys documenting her experiences in the orchard. When she’s not tending to her trees, you can find her exploring local farmers’ markets or experimenting with new fruit recipes in the kitchen.
She believes that the best way to enjoy fruit is to eat it fresh from the tree, and she loves to share her favorite varieties with friends and family. Jill is also a strong advocate for sustainable farming practices and is always looking for ways to improve her orchard’s environmental impact.</p>
